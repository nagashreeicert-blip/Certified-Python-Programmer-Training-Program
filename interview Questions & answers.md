## 🟢 Beginner Level (10 Questions)

### 1. What is Python and where is it used?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language used for web development, automation, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and system scripting.

---

### 2. Why is Python considered easy to learn?
Python uses readable syntax, minimal boilerplate code, and natural language–like structure, making it beginner-friendly.

---

### 3. What are Python keywords?
Keywords are reserved words with predefined meanings such as `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `def`, and `return`.

---

### 4. What is dynamic typing?
Dynamic typing means variable types are determined at runtime, not during declaration.

---

### 5. What is a list?
A list is an ordered, mutable collection that can store multiple data types.

---

### 6. What is a dictionary?
A dictionary stores data as key-value pairs and provides fast lookup.

---

### 7. What is a function?
A function is a reusable block of code created using the `def` keyword.

---

### 8. What is type casting?
Type casting converts one data type into another, such as `int()`, `float()`, or `str()`.

---

### 9. What is an operator?
Operators perform operations on variables and values, such as arithmetic or comparison.

---

### 10. What is Python indentation?
Indentation defines code blocks and is mandatory in Python.

---

## 🟡 Intermediate Level (10 Questions)

### 11. What is the difference between list and set?
- Lists allow duplicates and maintain order  
- Sets do not allow duplicates and are unordered  

---

### 12. Explain Python slicing.
Slicing extracts parts of sequences using `[start:end:step]`.

---

### 13. What are Python decorators?
Decorators modify the behavior of a function without altering its source code.

---

### 14. What is exception handling?
It prevents program crashes by handling runtime errors using `try`, `except`, and `finally`.

---

### 15. What is the purpose of `__init__`?
`__init__` initializes an object’s state when a class instance is created.

---

### 16. What are Python generators?
Generators produce values lazily using the `yield` keyword.

---

### 17. What is the difference between `break` and `continue`?
- `break` exits the loop  
- `continue` skips the current iteration  

---

### 18. What is a virtual environment?
An isolated Python environment used to manage project-specific dependencies.

---

### 19. What is the difference between `is` and `==`?
- `==` checks value equality  
- `is` checks memory reference  

---

### 20. What is file handling in Python?
File handling allows reading and writing data using modes like `r`, `w`, and `a`.

---

## 🔴 Advanced Level (10 Questions)

### 21. How does Python manage memory?
Python uses reference counting and garbage collection to manage memory.

---

### 22. What is the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)?
The GIL ensures only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time.

---

### 23. What is multiprocessing?
Multiprocessing runs processes in parallel using separate memory spaces.

---

### 24. What is asynchronous programming?
Async programming allows non-blocking execution using `async` and `await`.

---

### 25. What are Python metaclasses?
Metaclasses define how classes behave and are classes of classes.

---

### 26. Explain Python’s MRO.
Method Resolution Order defines the order in which parent classes are searched.

---

### 27. What is monkey patching?
Modifying classes or modules at runtime without changing source code.

---

### 28. What is serialization?
Serialization converts objects into a format suitable for storage or transfer.

---

### 29. How do you secure Python applications?
- Input validation  
- Environment variables  
- Secure dependencies  
- Authentication mechanisms  

---

### 30. How can Python performance be optimized?
- Use built-in functions  
- Reduce loops  
- Apply caching  
- Use multiprocessing  
- Profile code
